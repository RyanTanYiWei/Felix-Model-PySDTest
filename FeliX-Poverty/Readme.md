This version of the FeliX model was used in a research paper ("Robust strategies to end global poverty and reduce environmental pressures") submitted to One Earth.

FeliX (Functional Enviro-economic Linkages Integrated neXus) is a system dynamics model of global social, economic, and environmental Earth systems. More information can be found at:

Different versions of the FeliX model used in various publications and a full documentation of the model can be found at:

The model is developed on the modelling software Vensim, therefore the users should have Vensim installed to be able to display and simulate the model. This version of the FeliX model requires features that are available only in the licensed version, which is Vensim DSS. The users who have no access to Vensim DSS can still display the model by using the Vensim Model Reader.
