	~	Based on the IHME data, the ratio of LE at age gorups between 1-95+ to the \
		LE at birth has been almost constant (<10% change, <5% change in the age \
		groups below 75) over time between 1990 and 2019. Therefore, we assume \
		that LE is a constrant fraction of LE at birth. These constants are the \
		average of the ratio "LE (gender, age)/ LE at birth (both genders)" over \
